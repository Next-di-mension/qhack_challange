This file contains the data used to train and test the model. 

The _final.npy files are dataset that have already gone through the Classical Preprossing and Quantum Feature Maps and have been combined as used in our implementation. They are in the form of 4D Numpy arrays. 

We have also provided the images used before Classical Preprocessing and the batch files used before Quantum Feature Map Extraction
