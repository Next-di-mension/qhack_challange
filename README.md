# Implementation of classical-quantum CNN on MRI brain scans. 
Classification of MRI brain scan using a hybrid quantum-classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This work presents a method described in the following reference which improves the performance of classical CNN by adding a quantum convolutional layer to extract the features. The accuracy achieved by the model is upto 96.94% with the average loss of 0.0357.
